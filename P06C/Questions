1. Write a program that will create an array and load it with an 8 bit binary number (eg.
0011 0111). Validate the input i.e. the array can only hold 1’s or 0’s. Display the binary
number.
2. Adapt the question above so that your program can determine if the binary number is a
palindrome. (A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of symbols or
elements, whose meaning may be interpreted the same way in either forward or reverse
direction).
For Example :
1100 0011 is a palindrome
1101 0111 is not a palindrome
3. Write a program that will grade a True/False test. The test consists of 10 questions and
the correct answers are T T F F T T T F F T. Your program should prompt the user to
enter the answers to 10 questions and should display the score out of 10. (It is not
necessary to store the user answers in an array). Validate your input.
4. Adapt this question so that a correct answer is awarded 2 points and 1 point is deducted
if the answer is incorrect.
5. Adapt this program so that the user will be prompted to enter the number of students in
the class. Then the user should be continually asked to enter the answers for each of
the students. The score for each student should then be stored in another array called
results. The results for each student should be displayed on screen.
6. Adapt this question so that a different set of correct answers can be entered by the user
each time the program is used. The user should be asked for the number of questions in
the test, and should then be prompted to enter the correct answers. The program
should then continue as above.
7. Write a program using a two dimensional array with 3 rows and 4 columns. Read the
values into the array. Display the array on screen. Calculate and display the row totals
and the column totals.
Sample output
Array:
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
Total for Row 1: 10
Total for Row 2: 26
Total for Row 3: 42
Total for Column 1: 15
Total for Column 2: 18
Total for Column 3: 21
Total for Column 4: 24
8. A plane has 14 rows of seats with 6 seats in each row. Write a program that will allow
the user to book seats on the plane. The user should be able to book and cancel
(unbook) seats, find out how many seats are currently free, how many seats are
currently booked, and reset the seats (unbook all). The user will also want to see the
current bookings.
Flight booking system
1. Book a seat
2. Cancel a seat
3. Show current booking status
4. Reset
0. Quit
Enter option:
9. Write a program that will find the frequency distribution, the mode and the mean in the
following situation:
A class of 15 students sit an exam in which they can achieve a score from 0 to 10. Read
and store results in the exam for each student. Display the frequency distribution table.
Find and display the mode and the mean. The mode is most frequently occurring value
.
10. Implement the code for the Bubble sort and test it.

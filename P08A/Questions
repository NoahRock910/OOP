1. Write a program called OblongTester.java which instantiates (creates) a new
Oblong object.
o Use appropriate methods to access the values of each instance variable and
output them to screen.
o Prompt the user to enter values for height and width. Use the
appropriate methods to set the values of instance fields of your Oblong
object.
o Display the values of the Oblong instance variables on screen.
o Find and display the area of the object using the appropriate method.

2. Write a program which instantiates two Oblong objects. Use appropriate methods
to set their instance variables to values entered by the user. Your program should
then print out details of the Oblong which has the largest area.
The largest area is the Oblong with:
Width 5.0 and Height 7.0
Area 35.0

3. Before implementing each new method detailed in the questions below, write down
the method header/signature. Identify
• An appropriate name
• The returnType
• The name and type of any parameters that will be passed to this method
a) Define a new method that will calculate the perimeter of the Oblong. Test
your method.
b) Define a method that will determine if the Oblong is a square. Test the
method.
c) Add another method to the Oblong class that will increase the height and
width values of an Oblong by amounts passed as arguments. Test your
method.
d) Add a new method that will find the length of the diagonal of an Oblong
object. Test your method.
 Hint: Look in the Math class for a method to help with this calculation.
